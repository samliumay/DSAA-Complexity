# DSAA-Complexity
* DSAA = Data Structures and Algorithms 

## Introduction 
* As a data structures and algorithms fan, I wanted to create a lesson series for people who are trying to pass Data structres and Algorithms courses. The video explanations are at my superpeer. 

## What is included at this page and inside the codes? 
* Examples of different algorithms with different complexities.
* Basic explanation of why the complexity value of that algorithm is x.

## What do you explain at superpeer?
* I explain complexities deeply. 
* I explain how we calculate complext aglorithms complexity.
* I explain how we calculate the recursive Algorithms complexity.
