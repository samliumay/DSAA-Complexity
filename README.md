# DSAA - Complexity 
- DSAA = Data structures and Algorithms
## Explanation of Time Complexity
- Explains how to calculate it
- Teaches with examples with explanation about how to calculate the complexity.

# How to use/read and study?

1- Enter the 'CTAL/src/main/java/Main.java'

2- Firslty run the code and observe the output.

3- Then look to the 'ComplexityExamples.java'.

4- Read all lines one by one with the detailed explanation. 



NOTE-1: All the explanations and notes are integrated inside the code. So you can follow and learn just by reading the code. 

NOTE-2: Feel free to give feedback to me. I want to improve myself. If you want you can also take me a coffe :)
